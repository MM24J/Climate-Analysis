# sqlalchemy-challenge

This challenge involved doing a climate analysis for the Honolulu, HI area utilizing Python and SQLAlchemy, in order to plan a vacation. The data was obtained from the _Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology_'s article entitled "An Overview of the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily Database." Data on temperature and precipitation were explored over a 1-yr. time period. After completing the analysis, Flask API was designed, which returned a JSON of the temperature and precipiation data.
